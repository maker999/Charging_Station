# CryptoAuthLib-arduino
Arduino port of CryptoAuthLib

The original Atmel library has been changed as little as possible to make it compile under Arduino.  Most of the files are only moved to another folder to satisfy the Arduino build system.  Maybe this could be avoided using symbolic links.

The library supports ATSHA204A, ATECC108A and ATECC508A.  It has only been tested with ATSHA204A.  

The library has been tested with bitbang IÂ²C on pins 3 & 4 of the Arduino.  Change "i2c_bitbang_at88ck9000.cpp" if you want to use other pins.  The Arduino Wire library can't be used because its internal buffers are too small.

Up to now this library has only been used to generate "high quality" (dixit Atmel) random numbers.  Using the existing Atmel library compared to starting from scratch has the benefit of saving a lot of time and offers the option of easily adding extra features later on.
